# Hand-Written-digit-Recognition-Model

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The trained model is integrated with a simple Tkinter GUI that allows users to draw digits and get real-time predictions.

**Features**

* Uses Keras with TensorFlow backend for training the CNN model

* Trained on the standard MNIST dataset containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0â€“9)

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter

* Allows users to draw a digit on a canvas and recognize it using the trained model

**Technologies Used**

-> Python

-> Keras

-> TensorFlow

-> Tkinter

-> NumPy

**How It Works**

The CNN model is trained using Keras on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images and 10,000 test images).

The trained model is saved as digit_recognition_model.h5.

The GUI (GUI.py) allows users to draw digits in a canvas.

The drawing is preprocessed and passed to the model for prediction.
